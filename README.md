# PHP Send Mail Form

![MailMan](spam.jpg)

Just a simple **HTML** form:

* an input `email`
* a text area `message`
* a `send` submit button

When you click on the `send` submit button, it obviously send the `message` by mail to the recipient set in the `email` input!

To do that, you have to use a **PHP** Backend, check the official documentation, there is a `function` for that.

### Setup

```shell
sudo apt-get install sendmail
```

## Bonus

* Use _Bootstrap_ OR _Fundation_ OR _Material Design Light_
* Check if the mail address is valid (use **REGEX**)
* Limit the size of the message to 500 characters
* Let user add multiple recipients in `email` input
* Allow emoji, bold text, images, file attachements, even youtube videos
* Or anything else that you think is a cool feature!
